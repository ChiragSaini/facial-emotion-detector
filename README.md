# Face Emotion Detector

In this project i have trained a CNN using Keras and used it with Opencv3 library to detect as person's face emotion.
The model trained can detct upto five different emotions.These five meotions are: Happy, Sad, Angry, Suprise and Fear.


## How to use:
Simple open the ipynb file and run this all to train the model.
I am also including trained model, so you can directly use it with last code cell which uses opencv functions to detect it in real time.
