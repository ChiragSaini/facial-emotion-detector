# Face Emotion Detector

In this project i have trained a CNN using Keras(miniature version of VGG16) and used it with Opencv3 library to detect as person's face emotion.
The model trained can detct upto five different emotions.These five meotions are: Happy, Sad, Angry, Suprise and Fear.


## How to use:
Simple open the ipynb file and run this all to train the model.
I am also including trained model

but you can also it get trained in moderate time and 

you can use last code cell which uses opencv functions to detect it in real time.
